**Purpose**:
  Provide permissible limits for analyzing water quality. The information
  is taken from different standards, purporting to be applicable at
  specific locations, and for specific purposes. An application may
  use information from the given context or out-of-context, if 
  information for its purpose is missing, provided they suitably
  qualify the results.

**Notes**:
  - geoLimit: uses international country code (2 digit), and also standard
       state codes where applicable
  - type:
      * "accept_range": acceptable range is given between min_limit
            and max_limit
      * "generic": no limits are known
      * "highAccept": higher value than min_limit is better
      * "lowAccept": lower value than max_limit is better
